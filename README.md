# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub

Hello, fellow humans!

I'm Mikeyb1011, and I'm getting used to GitHub and all of it's wonderful uses!
I'm a self-taught programmer in most common languages, with formal education in others. 
I prefer Web Development, but also like Java, Unity C#, Swift, and Python. Thanks for checking this page out!
